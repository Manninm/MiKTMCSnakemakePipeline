Job 4: aligning Sample_70166/Sample_70166.R1.fq.gz Sample_70166/Sample_70166.R2.fq.gz /home/deepSeq/STAR_index_HS_38.86_small/ using STAR: 16 threads

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 43 of /home/manninm/pyflow-RNAseq/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
Sample_70166/Sample_70166Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
