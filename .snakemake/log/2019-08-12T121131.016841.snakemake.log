Removing output files of failed job StarCollect since they might be corrupted:
Reports/averageMappedLength.txt, Reports/input.txt, Reports/percentMultimappers.txt, Reports/unmappedTooShort.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
