Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 66 of /home/manninm/pyflow-RNAseq/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
